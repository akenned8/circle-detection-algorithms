<h1> Levenberg-Marquadt </h1>

The test file provided runs the <i>geometric</i> Levenberg-Marquadt circle fit algorithm in full (a,b,R) space 
by initially making a guess with the less accurate yet faster Taubin method (which is <i>algebraic</i>).

The code was taken and modified from this source: https://people.cas.uab.edu/~mosya/cl/CPPcircle.html which is a great resource that  
compares a few different circle fit algorithms.
